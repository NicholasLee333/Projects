Some projects I've worked on 
Hi Nick here! This is one of my projects that I have worked on. It's a basic top-down scroller.
The project was made to explore positioning and how it works on a 2D platform. The camera further
expands on the idea, as it uses offsets to recreate a map everytime it is called. We abuse this idea
to make the illusion of a "camera" which is basically a frame of visibility based of a central point.
